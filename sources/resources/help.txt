
	Syntax

	- line oriented
	- comments start with #
	- escaping of characters \x<HEX>
	  \x23 = #
	  \x20 = space
	- more commands
	  \R	line breaks (cross-platform)
	  \r    white spaces without line breaks
	  VOID	empty string when replacing (delete)
	  ...	continuation of the line

	A (anti)pattern has three lines.

	1. File Filter

	- backslash / slash are identical
	- placeholders * and ? are supported
	- delimiter + (include) and - (exclude)
	- exclusions at the level of place of finding
	  file[line] or file[line:char]

	2. Search Pattern

	- regular expression (searches the complete content)
	- follows the after first space an ! the following expression is
	  interpreted as exclusion:
		  Face\.\w+ !Face\.(xhtml|on(Show|Validate|Error|Event))
	  search: Face\.\w+, ignored: Face.xhtml, Face.onShow, Face.onValidate, ...
		  IMPORTANT:
	  The exclusion is only searched within the place of finding.
	  If located the exclusion outside, then the pattern must be extended.

	3. Action

	- replace expression ($1 - $9 are supported)
	- action starts with INFO: only one message is displayed
	- action starts with ECHO: or TEST: a preview of the replacement is
	  displayed
	- action is VOID the the reference is replaced by an empty string, which is
	  equal to the deletion

	Lines can be continue if they end with ... and after line breaks begin again
	with ... then the lines are used as one line.
