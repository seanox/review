# Description
#
# The anti-pattern file is a text file that is read line by line.
# A hash at the beginning of a line (blank characters are allowed before) marks
# the line as a comment. Comments are not read and skipped. Means they are
# processed as if the line does not exist.
# Characters can be encoded hexadecimal.
# 
#     e.g. \x<HEX> (\x23 = #, \x20 = space) 
# 
# The anti-pattern are organized in sections.
# A section begins after a blank line or if the line does not begin with a blank
# character. Therefore, the subsequent lines of a section are indented.
# If a line is to be continued exactly, the line must begin with blanks and
# '...'. The line is then continued with the first character after '...'.
#
# The section of a anti-pattern has three and more lines.
# 
#     line 1: file filter
# 
# - space characters are separators
# - every part of the filter must start with a directive
# - backslash / slash are identical
# - placeholders * and ? are supported
# - delimiter + (include) and - (exclude)
# 
#     line 2 and more: primary pattern, optional partial patterns (subpatterns)
#     
# - primary pattern is the main pattern (always an include)
#   The match found is then searched for Partial patterns.
#   Partial patterns can be inclusions and exclusions. Inclusions must begin
#   with + and - begin exclusions. The primary pattern has no directive.
#   All partial patterns must be true, only then is the action executed.
# - patterns are separated by white spaces
#   In a pattern, spaces must be encoded hexadecimal.
#
# AVOID LOOKBEHIND AT THE BEGINNING AND LOOKAHEAD AT THE END!
# THE PATTERNS ARE FOUND, EXTRACTED TO REPLACE BUT DO NOT FIT, BECAUSE MATCH
# STARTS AFTER LOOKBEHIND AND ENDS BEFORE LOOKAHEAD. 
#   
#     last line: action
#     
# The action is primarily a regular replacement, corresponding to the search
# pattern. When replacing, the groups and the backward references of the primary
# pattern can be used. Secondary patterns cannot be used.
# The action always starts with a command that can be followed by spaces and
# then other arguments.
# 
#     The following additional actions are supported:
#     
#     TEST <replacment>
# Displays a preview of the replacement without performing the replacement.    
#     
#     REMOVE
#     PATCH
# Deletes the match.
# No further arguments are expected.
# 
#     PRINT <message>
# Displays a information about a location without performing a replacement.
# 
#     PATCH <replacement>
# Performs the replacement if the replacement is allowed as a program argument.
# Otherwise, the command behaves like TEST.
